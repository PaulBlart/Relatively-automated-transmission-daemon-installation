Pretty much just wget from here, input username/password when prompted and it should finish up for you.

NOTE:

You should change settings.json download directory, which can be found in /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json
however, if you're lazy you could just use the username 'torrent' when prompted, however I would still advice you to change the default password in the settings.json fille (hint: default user/pass combination is torrent/torrent-pass-123)
